# Hydroponic Setup Builder and Planner
 is a web-based tool that allows users to design and plan their own DIY hydroponic NFT (Nutrient Film Technique) systems. The tool generates a dynamic 3D model and blueprint-style representation based on user-defined parameters such as system dimensions, plant count, tube diameter, and more.

## Features

-   **Dynamic 3D Model:** Real-time updates of the hydroponic system model based on user inputs.
-   **Blueprint Mode:** Technical, grid-based view with part numbers, dimensions, and measurements.
-   **Materials List:** Detailed item list that can be copied or downloaded for easy shopping and assembly.

## Technologies Used

-   **Next.js:** Server-side rendering and React-based framework for building the web application.
-   **React Three Fiber (R3F):** For managing and rendering the dynamic 3D models.
-   **Three.js:** Core library used for 3D modeling and rendering.
